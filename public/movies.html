<h2>Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr  />
<h3>The Twilight Series</h3>
<p>This movie taps into my childhood romance dreams. It provides love interests, heart break, vampires and wereworlves. Everything a young girl enjoys.</p>
<h3>Planet of the Apes Series</h3>
<p>As a child these movies are horrifying, however, once you reach a mature age you realize these movies are inspired by true human and industry inspiration.</p>
<h3>The Hangover Series</h3>
<p>I enjoy these movies because the writers and producers wrote hilarious scripts and the actors themselves executed comey perfectly. It is definetley a movie that will lift your spirits, even during the hard times.</p>
