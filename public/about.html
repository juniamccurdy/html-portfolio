<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I enjoy implementing others creativity as well as my own. Being able to design a form of marketing, 
  network, and personal expression for others provides me with a sense of delight like no other.</p>

<p>I I have 2 dogs. One being a meltese and the other a dachshund. They light up my days more
   than anything else. Aside from personal relationships, food is a huge contributor in my life. I 
  am a foodie at heart. Offer me any type of food and I won't hesistate to try it!</p>
